## MVC Sample Application
A ten-part video series developing a MVC Web application that allows a user to sign up to a newsletter. We first setup the solution in Visual Studio and make adjustments to the default views then update to the current versions of jQuert and bootstrap before starting work on the application. First we create a web form so the user can sign up to our newsletter then we pass the data inputted to the server where we validate it then either return an error or success message.
