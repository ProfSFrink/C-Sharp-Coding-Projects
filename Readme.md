## TwentyOne Game

## MVC Application - Students
An application developed over eleven parts to show our understanding of the Model-View-Controller desgin pattern and demonstrate what we learned in the MVC Tutorial.

## MVC Sample Application
A ten-part video series developing a MVC Web application that allows a user to sign up to a newsletter. We first setup the solution in Visual Studio and make adjustments to the default views then update to the current versions of jQuery and bootstrap before starting work on the application. First we create a web form so the user can sign up to our newsletter then we pass the data inputted to the server where we validate it then either return an error or success message. Then we create a database called Newsletter with a table called SignUps and then connect it to our application so we can add the information from a successful sign up to the table. Now we create a model that allows us to map the data from our database to a class so we can allow an admin to see all the signups that are in the database. We also implement a view model in our application so that we can only pass the information to the view that we need.
